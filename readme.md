# WELCOME TO THE COLDBOX SECURITY MODULE

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coldbox-modules/cbsecurity/development/visualizer.png">
</p>

This module will enhance your ColdBox applications by providing out-of-the-box security in the form of:

- A security rule engine for incoming requests allowing blocking, authentication, and authorization checks
- Annotation-driven security for handlers and actions
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) generator, decoder, rotation, invalidation and authentication services
- JWT Token Storage in a cache or database
- Refresh and access tokens
- Ip Blocking, Host Blocking, and much more
- CSRF protection
- Security Headers for protection against ip spoofing, host spoofing, click jacking, ssl attacks, hsts, and much more
- Pluggable with any Authentication service or can leverage [cbauth](https://github.com/coldbox-modules/cbauth) by default
- Basic auth capabilities with an internal user storage
- Capability to distinguish between invalid authentication and authorization and determine the process's outcome
- Ability to load/unload security rules from contributing modules. So you can create a nice HMVC hierarchy of security
- Ability for each module to define its own `validator`

## Requirements

- BoxLang 1+ (Preferred)
- Lucee 5+
- Adobe 2023+
- ColdBox 6+
- ColdBox 7+ for delegates and basic auth support only

## Installation

Use CommandBox to install

`box install cbsecurity`

You can then continue to configure the firewall in your `config/Coldbox.cfc`.

## Settings

Below are the security settings you can use for this module. Remember you must create the `cbsecurity` and `cbauth` structs in your `ColdBox.cfc` or you can create a `config/modules/cbsecurity.cfc` if you are on ColdBox 7.

```js
moduleSettings = {

	cbauth = {
		// This is the path to your user object that contains the credential validation methods
		userServiceClass = "entities.user"
	},

	cbsecurity = {

		 * By default we leverage the cbauth module which expects you to connect it to a database via your own User Service.
		 *
		 * Available authentication providers:
		 * - cbauth : Leverages your own UserService that determines authentication and user retrieval
		 * - basicAuth : Leverages basic authentication and basic in-memory user registration in our configuration
		 * - custom : Any other service that adheres to our IAuthService interface

			// by cbauth or basic authentication. (Optional)

			"prcUserVariable" : "oCurrentUser"
		},

## Usage

This module will automatically register the `Security` firewall interceptor for you according to the settings shown above and using the interceptor => (`cbsecurity.interceptor.Security`).

> **Info** You can deactivate this and load it as a manual interceptor via the `autoLoadFirewall` setting.

The interceptor will intercept all calls to your application via the `preProcess()` interception point. Each request will then be validated against registered security rules and against any active handler/action security annotations (if active) via a Security Validator. Also, if the request is made to a module, each module can have its own separate validator apart from the global one.

> **Info** You can deactivate annotation driven security via the `handlerAnnotationSecurity` setting.

### How does validation happen?

How does the interceptor know a user doesn't have access? Well, here is where you register a Validator CFC (`validator` setting) with `cbsecurity` that implements two validation functions: `ruleValidator() and annotationValidator()`.

> **Info** You can find an interface for these methods in `cbsecurity.interfaces.ISecurityValidator`

The validator's job is to tell back to the firewall if they are allowed access and if they don't, what type of validation they broke: **authentication** or **authorization** or just plainly **block** the request.

> `Authentication` is when a user is NOT logged in

> `Authorization` is when a user does not have the proper permissions to access an event/handler or action.

## Validation Process

Once the firewall has the results, and the user is **NOT** allowed access. Then the following will occur:

- The request will be logged via LogBox
- If the firewall database logs are enabled, then we will log it in our database logs
- The current URL will be flashed as `_securedURL` so it can be used in relocations
- If using a rule, the rule will be stored in `prc` as `cbsecurity_matchedRule`
- The validator results will be stored in `prc` as `cbsecurity_validatorResults`
- If the type of invalidation is `authentication` the `cbSecurity_onInvalidAuthentication` interception will be announced
- If the type of invalidation is `authorization` the `cbSecurity_onInvalidAuthorization` interception will be announced
- If the type is `authentication` the default action for that type will be executed (An override or a relocation) `invalidAuthenticationEvent`
- If the type is `authorization` the default action for that type will be executed (An override or a relocation) `invalidAuthorizationEvent`
- If the action is `block` then the firewall will block the request.

### Caveats

If you are securing a module, then the module has the capability to override the global settings if it declares them in its `ModuleConfig.cfc`

## Security Rules

Rules can be declared in your `config/ColdBox.cfc` or in any module's `ModuleConfig.cfc` inline, or they can come from the following sources:

- A JSON file
- An XML file
- The database by adding the configuration settings for it
- A model by executing the `getSecurityRules()` method from it

### Rule Anatomy

A rule is a struct that can be composed of the following elements. All of them are optional except the `secureList`.

```js
rules = [
    {
        "whitelist"     : "", // A list of white list events or Uri's
        "securelist"    : "", // A list of secured list events or Uri's
        "match"         : "event", // Match the event or a url
        "roles"         : "", // Attach a list of roles to the rule
        "permissions"   : "", // Attach a list of permissions to the rule
        "redirect"      : "", // If rule breaks, and you have a redirect it will redirect here
        "overrideEvent" : "", // If rule breaks, and you have an event, it will override it
        "useSSL"        : false, // Force SSL,
        "action"        : "", // The action to use (redirect|override|block) when no redirect or overrideEvent is defined in the rule.
        "module"        : "", // metadata we can add so mark rules that come from modules
		"httpMethods"   : "*", // Match all HTTP methods or particular ones as a list
		"allowedIPs"    : "*" // The rule only matches if the IP list matches. It can be a list of IPs to match.
    };
]
```

### Global Rules

The global rules come from the `config/Coldbox.cfc` and they are defined within the `cbsecurity` module setting.

```js
// Module Settings
moduleSettings = {
    // CB Security
    cbSecurity : {
       firewall : {
			// Global Relocation when invalid access is detected, instead of each rule declaring one.
			"invalidAuthenticationEvent"    : "main.index",
			// Global override event when invalid access is detected, instead of each rule declaring one.
			"invalidAuthorizationEvent"     : "main.index",
			// Default invalid action: override or redirect or block when invalid access is detected, default is to redirect
			"defaultAuthenticationAction"    : "block",
			// Default invalid action: override or redirect or block when invalid access is detected, default is to redirect
			"defaultAuthorizationAction"    : "redirect",
			// The global security rules as inline
        	"rules"                         : [
				// should use direct action and do a global redirect
				{
					"whitelist": "",
					"securelist": "admin",
					"match": "event",
					"roles": "admin",
					"permissions": "",
					"action" : "redirect"
				},
				// no action, use global default action
				{
					"whitelist": "",
					"securelist": "noAction",
					"match": "url",
					"roles": "admin",
					"permissions": ""
				},
				// Using overrideEvent only, so use an explicit override
				{
					"securelist": "ruleActionOverride",
					"match": "url",
					"overrideEvent": "main.login"
				},
				// direct action, use global override
				{
					"whitelist": "",
					"securelist": "override",
					"match": "url",
					"roles": "",
					"permissions": "",
					"action" : "override"
				},
				// Using redirect only, so use an explicit redirect
				{
					"securelist": "ruleActionRedirect",
					"match": "url",
					"redirect": "main.login"
				}
			]
	   }
    }
};
```

### Module Rules

Module rules come from the `ModuleConfig.cfc` by creating a `cbSecurity` key in the module's `settings` struct:

```js
// module settings - stored in modules.name.settings
settings = {

    // CB Security Rules to append to global rules
    cbsecurity = {
        firewall : {
			// Module Relocation when an invalid access is detected, instead of each rule declaring one.
			"invalidAuthenticationEvent"    : "mod1:secure.index",
			// Default Authentication Action: override or redirect or block when a user has not logged in
			"defaultAuthenticationAction"   : "override",
			// Module override event when an invalid access is detected, instead of each rule declaring one.
			"invalidAuthorizationEvent"     : "mod1:secure.auth",
			// Default Authorization Action: override or redirect or block when a user does not have enough permissions to access something
			"defaultAuthorizationAction"    : "override",
			// Custom validator for the module.
			"validator"                     : "JwtAuthValidator@cbsecurity"
			// You can define your security rules here or externally via a source
			"rules"                         : [
				{
					"secureList"    : "mod1:home"
				},
				{
					"secureList"    : "mod1/modOverride",
					"match"         : "url",
					"action"        : "override"
				}
			]
		}
    }

};
```

## Annotation Security

The firewall will inspect handlers for the `secured` annotation. This annotation can be added to the entire handler, an action, or both. The default value of the `secured` annotation is a boolean `true`. This means we need a user to be authenticated to access it.

```js
// Secure this handler
component secured{

    function index(event,rc,prc){}
    function list(event,rc,prc){}

}

// Same as this
component secured=true{
}

// Not the same as this
component secured=false{
}
// Or this
component{

    function index(event,rc,prc) secured{

    }

    function list(event,rc,prc) secured="list"{

    }

}
```

### Authorization Context

You can also give the annotation some value, which can be anything you like: A list of roles, a role, a list of permissions, metadata, etc. Whatever it is, this is the **authorization context**, and the security validator must be able to not only authenticate but authorize the context, or an invalid authorization will occur.

```js
// Secure this handler
component secured="admin,users"{

    function index(event,rc,prc) secured="list"{

    }

    function save(event,rc,prc) secured="write"{

    }

}
```

### Cascading Security

By annotating the handler and the action, you create a cascading security model where they need to be able to access the handler first, and only then will the action be evaluated for access.

## Security Validator

Now that we have seen security rules and annotations let's see how to validate them. Create a CFC or use any CFC in your `models` and add the following functions: `ruleValidator() and annotationValidator()`

```js
/**
 * This function is called once an incoming event matches a security rule.
 * You will receive the security rule that matches and an instance of the ColdBox controller.
 *
 * You must return a struct with the following keys:
 * - allow:boolean True, user can continue access, false, invalid access actions will ensue
 * - type:string(authentication|authorization) The type of block that ocurred.  Either an authentication or an authorization issue.
 * - messages:string Any messages for debugging
 *
 * @return { allow:boolean, type:string(authentication|authorization), messages:string }
 */
struct function ruleValidator( required rule, required controller );

/**
 * This function is called once access to a handler/action is detected.
 * You will receive the secured annotation value and an instance of the ColdBox Controller
 *
 * You must return a struct with the following keys:
 * - allow:boolean True, user can continue access, false, invalid access actions will ensue
 * - type:string(authentication|authorization) The type of block that ocurred.  Either an authentication or an authorization issue.
 * - messages:string Any messages for debugging
 *
 * @return { allow:boolean, type:string(authentication|authorization), messages:string }
 */
struct function annotationValidator( required securedValue, required controller );
```

Each validator must return a struct with the following keys:

- `allow:boolean` A boolean indicator if authentication or authorization was violated
- `type:stringOf(authentication|authorization)` A string that indicates the type of violation: authentication or authorization.
- `messages:string` A string of messages used for debugging

Here is a sample validator using permission-based security in both rules and annotation context

```js

struct function ruleValidator( required rule, required controller ){
    return permissionValidator( rule.permissions, controller, rule );
}
struct function annotationValidator( required securedValue, required controller ){
    return permissionValidator( securedValue, controller );
}
private function permissionValidator( permissions, controller, rule ){
    var results = { "allow" : false, "type" : "authentication", "messages" : "" };
    var user    = security.getCurrentUser();

    // First check if user has been authenticated.
    if( user.isLoaded() AND user.isLoggedIn() ){
        // Do we have the right permissions
        if( len( arguments.permissions ) ){
            results.allow   = user.checkPermission( arguments.permission );
            results.type    = "authorization";
        } else {
            results.allow = true;
        }
    }

    return results;
}
```

## Interceptions

### Authentication / Authorization

When invalid access or authorizations occur, the interceptor will announce the following events:

- `cbSecurity_onInvalidAuthentication` - When an invalid authentication is detected
- `cbSecurity_onInvalidAuthorization` - When an invalid authorization is detected

You will receive the following data in the `interceptData` struct:

- `ip` : The offending Ip address
- `rule` : The security rule intercepted or empty if annotations
- `settings` : The firewall settings
- `validatorResults` : The validator results
- `annotationType` : The annotation type intercepted, `handler` or `action` or empty if rule driven
- `processActions` : A boolean indicator that defaults to true.  If you change this to false, then the interceptor won't fire the invalid actions. Usually this means, you manually will do them.

### Firewall Blocks

- `cbSecurity_onFirewallBlock` - When the firewall blocks an incoming request with a 403

You will receive the following data in the `interceptData` struct:

- `type` : The type of block: `hostheader` or `ipvalidation`
- `config` : The configuration structure of the rule
- `incomingIP` : The incoming ip if the type is `ipValiation`
- `incomingHost` : The incoming host if the type is `hostHeader`

## Security Visualizer

This module also ships with a security visualizer that will document all your security rules and settings in a nice panel. In order to activate it you must add the `visualizer` setting to your config and mark it as `enabled`. Once enabled you can navigate to: `/cbsecurity,` and you will be presented with the visualizer.

> **Important** The visualizer is disabled by default

To run the tests, start one of the servers from the `/test-harness` directory.

You will also need a MySQL database seeded with the `/test-harness/tests/resources/cbsecurity.sql` file.
Docker makes this a cinch:

```sh
docker run -d \
  --name=cbsecurity \
  -p 3306:3306 \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysql \
  -e MYSQL_DATABASE=cbsecurity \
  -v $(pwd)/test-harness/tests/resources/cbsecurity.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/cbsecurity.sql \
  mysql:5
```

Finally, run the tests by visiting your server's `/tests/runner.cfm` file.

### HONOR GOES TO GOD ABOVE ALL

Because of His grace, this project exists. If you don't like this, then don't read it, it's not for you.

>"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:
By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;
And patience, experience; and experience, hope:
And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the
Holy Ghost which is given unto us. ." Romans 5:5

### THE DAILY BREAD

 > "I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but by me (JESUS)" Jn 14:1-12
