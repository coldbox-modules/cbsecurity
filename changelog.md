## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Parenthesis on `top` statements for MSSQL Server on the `DBLogger` thanks to @irvirv

## [3.4.0] - 2023-06-14

### Added

- Official Adobe 2023 Support
- Gitflows for testing all engines and all versions of ColdBox
- Added `transientCache=false` to auth `User` to avoid any issues when doing security operations
- Added population control for auth `User` for extra security

### Fixed

- `User` auth was not serializing the `id` of the user in the mementifier config

## [3.3.0] => 2023-MAR-31

### Added

- Added `guest()` method to CBSecurity model and `Authorizable` delegate

## [3.2.0] => 2023-MAR-29

### Added

- Migrations table for security logs
- New bootsrap icons + css + js
- New github support files

### Fixed

- `getActionsReport()` was not defaulting the type's structure, so exceptions would arise when there was no data in the visualizer

## [3.1.0] => 2023-FEB-17

### Added

- Added a new helper: `createPassword()` on the `CBSecurity` model to generate secure, random passwords with letters, symbols and numbers.
- `cbcsrf` upgraded to version 3, we missed in the previous release.

## [3.0.0] => 2023-JAN-17

### Changed / COMPATIBILITY

- Dropped ACF2016
- Separated routes to it's own module Router
- **COMPAT** New `JwtAuthValidator` instead of mixing concerns with the `JwtService`.  You will have to update your configuration to use this `validator` instead of the `JwtService`
- `useSSL` is now defaulted to `true` for all security relocations as the default
- Encapsulation of `jwt` settings from the `ModuleConfig` to the `JwtService`
- `CBAuthValidator` has been renamed to just `AuthValidator` this way it can be used with ANY authentication service instead of binding it to just `cbauth`.  This validator just relies on the `IAuthUser` interface now.

### Added

- New `AuthValidator` now can validate permissions and roles according to our `IAuthUser` interface but can be used on ANY authentication service that implements `IAuthService`
- New authorization and authentication delegates for usage in cb7
- New ability for the firewall to log all action events to a database table.
- New visualizer that can visualize all settings and all firewall events via the log table if enabled.
- New Basic Auth validator and basic auth user credentials storage system. This will allow you to secure your apps where no database interaction is needed or required.
- New global and rule action: `block` and the fireall will block the request with a 401 Unathorized page.
- New event `cbSecurity_onFirewallBlock` announced whenever the firewall blocks a request into the system with a 403.
- `DBTokenStorage` now rotates using async scheduler and not direct usage anymore.
- Ability to set the `cbcsrf` module settings into the `cbsecurity` settings as `csrf`.
- We now default the user service class and the auth token rotation events according to used authentication service (cbauth, etc), no need to duplicate work.
- New rule based IP security. You can add a `allowedIPs` key into any rule and add which IP Addresses are allowed into the match. By default, it matches all IPs.
- New rule based HTTP method security. You can add a `httpMethods` key into any rule and add which HTTP methods are allowed into the match. By default, it matches all HTTP Verbs.
- New `securityHeaders` configuration to allow a developer to protect their apps from common exploits: xss, HSTS, Content Type Options, host header validation, ip validation, click jacking, non-SSL redirection and much more.
- Authenticated user is now stored by the security firewall according to the `prcUserVariable` on authenticated calls via `preProcess()` no matter the validator used
- Dynamic Custom Claims: You can pass a function/closure as the value for a custom claim and it will be evaluated at runtime passing in the current claims before being encoded
- Allow passing in custom refresh token claims to `attempt()` and `fromUser()` and `refreshToken()` : `refreshCustomClaims`
- Added `TokenInvalidException` and `TokenExpiredException` to the `refreshToken` endpoint

### Fixed

- Disable lastAccessTimeouts for JWT CacheTokenStorage BOX-128
- Fix spelling of property `datasource` on queryExecute that was causing a read issue.

## [2.15.0] => 2021-DEC-10

### :rocket: Added

- Pass custom claims from `refreshToken( token, customClaims)` method when refreshing tokens
- Pass in the current jwt payload in to `getJWTCustomClaims( payload )`
- The auto refresh token features now will auto refresh not only on expired tokens, but on invalid and missing tokens as well. Thanks to @elpete

### :bug: Fixed

- Timeout in token storage is now the token timeout

## [2.14.0] => 2021-OCT-07

### Added

- `threadsafe` annotation to all models to prevent invalid creations under load, since we don't use circular dependencies.

## [2.13.0] => 2021-SEP-02

### Added

- Adobe 2021 Support
- Migration to github actions from travis
- Refresh tokens support
- Refresh token endpoint `/cbsecurity/refreshtToken` for secure refresh token generation
- Manual refresh token method on the `JwtService` : `refreshToken( token )`
- Auto refresh token header interceptions for JWT validators
- Detect on `authenticate()` if the payload is empty and throw the appropriate exceptions
- Added ability for the `authenticate( payload )` to receive a payload to authenticate
- Added ability to recreate the token storage using a `force` argument `getTokenStorage( force = false )`
- Ability for the `parseToken()` to choose to store and authenticate or just parse

### Changed

- The `IAuthUser` no longer requires the `isLoggedIn()` method. This is now fully optional.

### Fixed

- Unique `jti` could have collisions if tokens created at the same time, add randomness to it
- `TokenExpirationException` not relaeyed from the base jwt library
- If `variables.settings.jwt.tokenStorage.enabled` is disabled all invalidations failed, make sure if the storage is disabled to not throw storage exceptions.

## [2.12.0] => 2021-MAR-29

### Added

- More and more apps will need real ip's from request, so expose it via the `CBSecurity` model service as : `getRealIp()`

### Fixed

- When using `getHTTPREquestData()` send `false` so we DON'T retrieve the http body when we just need the headers
- More updates to `getRealIp()` when dealing with lists

## [2.11.1] => 2021-MAR-10

### Fixed

- Fix `getRealIP()` to only return originating user's source IP, if the forwarded ip is a list

## [2.11.0] => 2021-MAR-10

### Added

- Add a `secureSameUser` method to throw when passed a different user #29 (<https://github.com/coldbox-modules/cbsecurity/pull/29>)

## [2.10.0] => 2021-FEB-12

### Added

- Moved the registration of the validator from the `configure()` to the `afterAspectsLoad()` interception point to allow for modules to declare the validator if needed.
- Moved handler bean to `afterAspectsLoad()` to allow for module based invalid events to work.

## [2.9.0] => 2020-DEC-11

### Fixed

- Fixes a typo in the `cbSecurity_onInvalidAuthorization` interception point declaration. Previously, the typo would prevent ColdBox from allowing the correctly-typed interception point from ever triggering an interception listener.
- The `userValidator()` method has been changed to `roleValidator()`, but the error message was forgotten! So the developer is told they need a `userValidator()` method... because the `userValidator` method is no longer supported. :/

### Added

- The `isLoggedIn()` method now makes sure that a jwt is in place and valid, before determining if you are logged in or not.
- Migrated all automated tests to `focal` and `mysql8` in preparation for latest updates
- Add support for JSON/XML/model rules source when loading rules from modules.  Each module can now load rules not only inline but from the documented external sources.
- Ensure non-configured `rules` default to empty array

## [2.8.0] => 2020-NOV-09

### Added

- `parseToken( token )` now accepts a token of your choice to work with in the request or it will continue to discover it if not passed.
- Added new JWT Service method: `invalidateAll()` which invalidates all tokens in the token storage
- Added the new event: `cbSecurity_onJWTInvalidateAllTokens` that fires once all tokens in the storage are cleared
- Added storage of the authenticated user into the `prc` scope when using `attempt()` to be consistent with API calls

### Fixed

- Spelling corrections on the readme
- Added full var scoping for `cbsecurity` in JWTService calls

## [2.7.0] => 2020-SEP-14

### Added

- Contributed module rules are now pre-pended instead of appended. (@wpdebruin)

### Fixed

- Not loading rules by source file detection due to invalid setting check
- Don't trigger ColdBox's invalid event looping protection. It also auto-senses between ColdBox 6 and 5 (@homestar9)
- Fixed token scopes according to JWT spec, it is called `scope` and it is a space separated list. This doesn't change the User interface for it. (@wpdebruin)
- Update token storages so no token rejection anymore when storage is not enabled. (@wpdebruin)

## [2.6.0] => 2020-JUL-22

### Added

- New build layout based on new module layout
- Auto github publishing release notes
- More formatting goodness and watcher

### Fixed

- JWT Validator now passing `permissions` instead of `roles`
- Token Storage checking was being done even if disabled

## [2.5.0] => 2020-APR-03

- `Feature` : Upgraded to `cbAuth` @ 5.x

## [2.4.0] => 2020-APR-02

- `Feature` : We now include the `cbcsrf` module to allow for protections of cross site request forgery vectors. Please see all the features included in this module here: <https://github.com/coldbox-modules/cbcsrf>

## [2.3.0] => 2020-MAR-30

- `Feature` Introduction of the cbSecurity model: <https://coldbox-security.ortusbooks.com/intro/release-history/whats-new-with-2.3.0>
- `Task` : Cfformatting everywhere

## [2.2.1] => 2020-FEB-26

- `bug` : `verify` should pass `verify=true` into the jwt library for proper verification

## [2.2.0] => 2020-FEB-12

- `Feature` : Migrated from the jwt to the `jwtcfml` (<https://forgebox.io/view/jwt-cfml>) library to expand encoding/decoding capabilities to support `RS` and `ES` algorithms:
  - HS256
  - HS384
  - HS512
  - RS256
  - RS384
  - RS512
  - ES256
  - ES384
  - ES512
- `Feature` : Added a new convenience method on the JWT Service: `isTokenInStorage( token )` to verify if a token still exists in the token storage
- `Feature` : If no jwt secret is given in the settings, we will dynamically generate one that will last for the duration of the application scope.
- `Feature` : New setting for `jwt` struct: `issuer`, you can now set the issuer of tokens string or if not set, then cbSecurity will use the home page URI as the issuer of authority string.
- `Feature` : All tokens will be validated that the same `iss` (Issuer) has granted the token
- `Improve` : Ability to have defaults for all JWT settings instead of always typing them in the configs
- `Improve` : More cfformating goodness!
- `Bug` : Invalidation of tokens was not happening due to not using the actual key for the storage

## [2.1.0] => 2019-OCT-02

- `Feature` : cbauth upgraded to version 4

## [2.0.0] => 2019-SEP-25

### New Features

- Adobe 2016,2018 Support
- Settings transferred to ColdBox 4/5 `moduleSettings` approach instead of root approach (See compat section)
- The `rulesModelMethod` now defaults to `getSecurityRules()`
- ColdFusion security validator has an identity now `CFValidator@cbsecurity` instead of always being inline.
- You can now add an `overrideEvent` element to a rule. If that is set, then we will override the incoming event via `event.overrideEvent()` instead of doing a relocation using the `redirect` rule element.
- You can now declare your rules inline in the configuration settings using the `rules` key. This will allow you to build the rules in your config instead of a rule source.
- We now can distinguish between invalid auth and invalid authorizations
- New interception block points `cbSecurity_onInvalidAuthentication`, `cbSecurity_onInvalidAuhtorization`
- You now have a `defaultAuthorizationAction` setting which defaults to `redirect`
- You now have a `invalidAuthenticationEvent` setting that can be used
- You now have a `defaultAuthenticationAction` setting which defaults to `redirect`
- You now have a `invalidAuthorizationEvent` setting that can be used
- If a rule is matched, we will store it in the `prc` as `cbSecurity_matchedRule` so you can see which security rule was used for processing invalid access actions.
- If a rule is matched we will store the validator results in `prc` as `cbSecurity_validatorResults`
- Ability for modules to register cbSecurity rules and setting overrides by registering a `settings.cbSecurity` key.
- Ability for modules to override the `validator` setting. So each module can have their own security validator schema.
- New security rule visualizer for graphically seeing you rules and configuration.  Can be locked down via the `enableSecurityVisualizer` setting. Disabled by default.

```json
// module settings - stored in modules.name.settings
settings = {
	// CB Security Rules to append to global rules
	cbsecurity = {
		// The module invalid authentication event or URI or URL to go if an invalid authentication occurs
		"invalidAuthenticationEvent"	: "",
		// Default Auhtentication Action: override or redirect when a user has not logged in
		"defaultAuthenticationAction"	: "redirect",
		// The module invalid authorization event or URI or URL to go if an invalid authorization occurs
		"invalidAuthorizationEvent"		: "",
		// Default Authorization Action: override or redirect when a user does not have enough permissions to access something
		"defaultAuthorizationAction"	: "redirect",
		// You can define your security rules here or externally via a source
		"rules"							: [
			{
				"secureList" 	: "mod1:home"
			},
			{
				"secureList" 	: "mod1/modOverride",
				"match"			: "url",
				"action"		: "override"
			}
		]
	}
};
```

- Annotation based security for handlers and actions using the `secured` annotation.  Which can be boolean or a list of permissions, roles or whatever you like.
- You can disable annotation based security by using the `handlerAnnotationSecurity` boolean setting.

## Improvements

- SSL Enforcement now cascades according to the following lookup: Global, rule, request
- Interfaces documented for easier extension `interfaces.*`
- Migration to script and code modernization
- New Module Layout
- Secured rules are now logged as `warn()` with the offending Ip address.
- New setting to turn on/off the loading of the security firewall: `autoLoadFirewall`. The interceptor will auto load and be registered as `cbsecurity@global` in WireBox.

### Compat

- Lucee 4.5 Dropped
- Migrate your root `cbSecurity` settings in your `config/ColdBox.cfc` to inside the `moduleSettings`
- IOC rules support dropped
- OCM rules support dropped
- `validatorModel` dropped in favor of just `validator` to be a WireBox Id
- Removed `preEventSecurity` it was too chatty and almost never used
- The function `userValidator` has been renamed to `ruleValidator` and also added the `annotationValidator` as well.
- `rulesSource` removed you can now use the `rules` setting
  - The `rules` can be: `array, db, model, filepath`
